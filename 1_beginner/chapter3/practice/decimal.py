# Decimal
# Write a program that asks the user for a floating point number as input.
# It prints out the decimal part (the part to the right of the decimal point).
# Don't worry about floating point errors!
# Note: To display a more exact output, you can use
# rounded_decimal = round(decimal_variable, 10)
# to set rounded_decimal to your decimal_variable rounded to a precision
# of 10 decimal places.
