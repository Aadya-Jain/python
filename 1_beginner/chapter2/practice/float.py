# Float
# Write a program that takes a float from the user
# and stores it in a variable. Cast the number to an
# integer and store in another variable.
# Then print: (floating point number) = (integer number).
# For example, if the user enters 5, the output would be:
# 5.0 = 5
# Also print the type of the floating point variable.
# Remember! type(variable_name) will return the data type of a variable

# Write code here
