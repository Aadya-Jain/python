# Printing

# You can print other types besides strings; we'll get to that later
print("Hello")
print(1)
print(99.99)

# Strings can be in single or double quotes
print("Message")
print("Message")

# You can print with multiple arguments
# Arguments are separated by a space by default
print("Message", "with", "arguments")

# You can use string concatenation ("adding")
# to put strings together (just be careful about spacing!)
print("Message" + "with" + "concatenation")  # no spaces between words
