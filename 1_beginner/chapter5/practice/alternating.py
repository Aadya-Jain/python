"""
Alternating
Ask the user for an integer. Then print the numbers from 1
to that number, but alternating in sign. For example, if the input
was 5, what would be printed is 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 4, -4, 5.
(Note, DO NOT include the last negative number).
Do this with a for loop and then with a while loop.
