"""

Write a program to check if a number is prime or not. A prime
number is one that is not divisible by any number other than
1 and itself. For example, 11 is prime because it is not divisible
by 2,3,4,5,...10 (i.e. 11/10, for example, is not an integer).

Write a for loop to check if a number is prime or not.

# write code here

numer = int(input("Enter number here: "))

"""
Given a number less than or equal to 10 billion, see if you can check if it is
prime in UNDER 2 SECONDS. The code you wrote above probably wont do that, so
you will have to figure out a clever solution.

NOTE: THE ABOVE IS A CHALLENGE PROBLEM, AND IS EXTRREEMMLY HARD TO DO.
I COULDN'T DO IT OPTIMALY UNTIL I LEARNED HOW TO. If you can't
figure out the solution, don't feel discouraged, its seriously a really
hard problem (I have seen this asked to college students :O)
