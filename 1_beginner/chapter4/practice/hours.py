# Hours
# Write a program that asks the user
# how many hours they spend on the internet
# per day, and return if theyâ€™re addicted
# or not based on the hours. (5 or more hours
# is addicted, less is not).

# write code here


# See if you can write the same program, but they are addicted on if the number they input (x) is great than two times 
#the remainder of that number when divided by 7 (remainder when x is deivided by 7)
