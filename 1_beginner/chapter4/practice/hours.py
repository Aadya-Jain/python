# Write a program that asks the user
# how many hours they spend on the internet
# per day, and return if theyâ€™re addicted
# or not based on the hours. (5 or more hours
# is addicted, less is not).

# write code here

# See if you can write the same program,
# except that the user is addicted to the internet
# if the number of hours they spend on the internet
# is greater than 2 times the remainder of hours / 7
