"""
A restaurant menu has food and drink sections,
each from which the customer must choose an order.
By default, any combination of food and drink orders
are $1,000,000,000. But if the customer enters 'french toast'
AND 'coffee', there is a discount of $1.
And if the customer enters 'chicken soup' OR 'apple juice',
the price increases by $1. Write a program that takes an
order from a user and prints out the appropriate price.
Assume that all inputs are in lowercase and that it is
always food first, and then drink.
