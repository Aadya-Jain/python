Names

Make a list called people and fill it with
at least 6 names. Make another list and use
list slicing to fill it with every other name
from the original list, starting with the 1st name.
Print both lists.

# Insert your code here.

Use a for loop to ask the user to add 4 names
to the list. After you ask for each name, print
