Indexing

1. Create a list with the following names:
    Mark
    Arya
    Paz
    Lulu
    Jon
    Robin
2. Print the first element of the list.
3. Print the 3rd-to last name ("Lulu") WITHOUT
using people[3].
4. Print the second element of the list.

Don't "hard-code" the answers.
For example, don't write print("Mark").
Instead, use list indexing to get the values
from the list.
