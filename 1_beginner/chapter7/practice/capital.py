"""
Capital

Write a program that takes a string as input,
makes every other letter capital, sets the rest
of the characters to be lowercase, and displays
the new string.

Hint: Make sure you don't count non-alphabetic
characters.

Example input: I love Zee the Cat.
Example output: I lOvE zEe ThE cAt.
