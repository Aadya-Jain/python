Phone Number

Write a program that asks the user to input a phone number.
Strip their input to get rid of any accidental spaces.

If the input has anything besides digits or the input
isnâ€™t exactly 10 digits long, The program should keep asking them
for a phone number until the input is formatted correctly.

Display the phone number at the end.

Example program run:
Enter a phone number (10 digits): 732-000-0000
Enter a phone number (10 digits): abcdeabcde
Enter a phone number (10 digits): (908)9999999
Enter a phone number (10 digits): 732000000
Enter a phone number (10 digits): 1234567891
Your number is 1234567891

number = ""
while len(number) != 10 or not number.isdigit():
    number = input("Enter a phone number (10 digits): ")

print("Your number is", number)
