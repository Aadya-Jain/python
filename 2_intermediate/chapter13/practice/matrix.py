"""
Build a class called Matrix which will take a list of lists
(containing integers) and store it as a field. Add an assertion
using the keyword assert to ensure that the list of lists is
rectangular (i.e. assert len(list_0) = len(list_i) for i in range(n))
You should also implement a __str__ method so that we can print
the contents of the matrix using print without having to access its field.
