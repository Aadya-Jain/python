"""
Reimplement the __lt__ and __gt__  in the given Vector
class(the one in this section) so that we are comparing
the vector's contents based on lexicographical ordering.
Think of lexicographical ordering as how you arrange words
in a dictionary. For instance, by lexicographical ordering,
'a' < 'ab', 'ab' < 'ad', 'bcd' > 'a'. It works analogously
for numbers, but instead, each character has been substituted
by a number.
