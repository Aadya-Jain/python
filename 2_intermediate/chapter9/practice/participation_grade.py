# name in the list is the number of times the student participated in this week.
# If a student has more the 7 participation, then got an A. If a student has
# more than 3 but less than 8, the student got a B. If a student has more than
# 0 but less than 4, the student got a C.

# Make a dictionary with the keys as the students' name and the values as the
# corresponding student's letter grade. Print the dictionary
