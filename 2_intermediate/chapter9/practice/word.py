"""
Word

Store words (keys) and definitions (values)
in a dictionary in a random order.

Then, ask the user to input a word.
If the word is in the dictionary,
use it to display the definition.
Otherwise, print out a message saying
that the word is not there.

Display the entire dictionary at the end in the format:
word1: definition1
word2: definition2
etc.
