# Write a function called remove_duplicates
# The sole parameter of the function should be a list
# The function should look through a list,
# Find all duplicate elements, and remove them
# Sort the resulting list
# Hint: To sort a list, use sorted(list)
# Another hint: Use list.count(element)
# To count the number of times that element appears

# Example: array = [1,1,2,5,4,6,12,3,4,6]
# Result should print [1,2,3,4,5,6,12]

# Write code here
