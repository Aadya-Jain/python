# Write a function called count_magical
# that returns the number of even numbers
# in a given list. In the function,
# if the number of evens is greater than
# half of the length of the list, print "Magical"
# Else, print "Not Magical"
#
# Write a function called main which tests
# the count_magical function on at least
# 3 different lists of integers. Use the main
# function to test count_magical by calling main().
