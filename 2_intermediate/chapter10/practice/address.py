Address

Create a 2D list where each row represents a
person and has 3 elements: their name, their age,
and their address.

The entire list should have 4 such entries (4 people),
so it will be a 4x3 list.

Display the name and address of the 2nd person in the list.

Then, display the entire list with the format:
name (age): address
