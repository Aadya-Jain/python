# Given a 2D list, let's call a element "smooth" if index of the
# element in its 1D list plus the element is even. For example,
# given the 2D list [[0,4][2,6]], the 1st element of each of the
# 1D list is considered "smooth" because 0 + 0 is 0 and 0 + 2 is 2
# (both are even numbers). Find the maximum "smooth" element and
# print it. Using the example [[0,4][2,6]] again, the maximum
# "smooth" element is 2 because 2 is bigger than 0.
