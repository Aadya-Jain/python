Follow these steps to create this algorithm.
1) Store words and definitions in a dictionary(or a list, if you want, depending on how you write the code).
2) Generate a grid(this should probably be in a 2D list) and fill it randomly with the words and definitions.
Display the grid and indicate that all cards are flipped down.
3) For every turn:
3a) Display the grid(showing which cards have been flipped up so far).
3ai) Define a function called display_grid() to do this.
3b) Ask the user to pick 2 locations(they should input the row and column of each position they choose).
If they pick a location with a card that’s already flipped up, ask them to pick again.
3c) Check whether the cards at the chosen locations are a matching word/definition pair.
Give the user a message telling them whether they chose correctly or not.
3d) Update the grid display, so that if the user guessed correctly, they’ll see empty spots on the grid display during the next turn.
4) Display a win message when the user has all the cards flipped up(when they’ve found all the word/definition pairs).
