# Python
Source code from Code For Tomorrow's Python course

Source code is organized under 3 directories:
1. `examples` - example code to demo certain programming concepts
2. `practice` - practice exercise templates for students to write code
3. `solutions` - solutions to practice exercises

Under each of the 3 packages, source code is further divided into difficulty level:
1. `1_beginner`
2. `2_intermediate`
3. `3_advanced`
