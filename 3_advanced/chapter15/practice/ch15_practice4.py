The following code is not meant to be run because
there's no input. Instead, analyze it's running time
in terms of Big-O. The first two lines are already
analyzed for you. Do the same for all the other lines.
The input of the problem is ex_list, and assume it
has n elements. At the end, put the total running
time of code. Note: You will be surprised!
