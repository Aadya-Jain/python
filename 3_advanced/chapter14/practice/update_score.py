# Problem name: update_score
# A hacker named Dan wishes to hack into a competition where they judge participants in three categories on a scale of 10.
# Dan wants his friend Bob to win.
# Bob will only win if he has all 10s while the other competitors, Jo and Stan, don’t.

# Judges will store the scoring within a tuple ([...], [...], [...]).
# The scores before Dan hacked are given.
# Bob will be located as the first person the judges scored and will have the lowest points out of any participant.
# Create a program to help Dan help Bob win.
# Also, print Bob’s score at the end.
# Use tuple unpacking to solve this problem.

# the scores are given
scores = ([1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3])
