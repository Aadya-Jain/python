# Fred had lost his teddy bear, so his parents are going to the store
# to buy a replacement for him. You are given a list of length 2
# (2 elements) tuples, where each tuple represents a teddy bear. where
# the first element contains a number showing how similar that that bear is
# to Fred's original teddy bear(the smaller, the better), and the second
# element is a string of the teddy bear's name.
# Find the teddy bear closest to the one Fred lost, and print its name
# (donâ€™t worry about tuples w/ same #)
