# Given n number of cities (essentially a list of cities numbered
# from 0 to n-1), and a list of “bridges” with some arbitrary cost
# (how expensives that bridge is to build) which can connect two
# cities (you can move both directions along it), finda set of bridges
# such that when built you can reach any city from any starting city
# and that the combined cost of building the bridges is the cheapest
# possible. (this problem is called the minimum spanning tree) It
# should return the minimum total cost of building such a set of
# bridges (don’t return which those bridges are)


# numberOfCities: number of cities that needs to be connected
# possibleBridges: a vector containing a vectors each of size 3
# which denotes [cityA, cityB, cost]
def findMinimumCost(numberOfCities, possibleBridges):
    # put your code here; remove pass
