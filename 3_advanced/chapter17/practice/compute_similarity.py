# Given two sets of integers A and B (each element in these sets are between 1 and 1000 inclusive),
# find the similarity of the two sets (the sets are guaranteed to be nonempty). The similarity is
# a number which is computed by dividing the size of the intersection of the two sets by their union size.
# Note: the intersection is the # of elements that both sets have in common.
