"""
An ice cream shop keeps all its available flavours
in a set. Every month, it gets a list of all the
flavours that are no longer available. Return
a new set containing the available flavours this
month after all the no-longer-available flavours
are removed. It is possible to solve this problem
using either discard or remove.
