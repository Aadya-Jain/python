"""
Given a set, remove all the even numbers from
it, and for each even number removed, add
"Removed [insert the even number you removed]".
Example: {1,54, 2, 5} becomes {"Removed 54", 1,
5, "Removed 2"}. It is possible to solve this
problem using either discard or remove.

def odd_set_day(given_set):
    pass
    # Remove pass and write your code in here


given_set = {1, 2, 4, 5}
odd_set_day(given_set)
print(given_set)
