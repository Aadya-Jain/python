# Write a function that accesses a global list. It should try to
# take the user’s input for how many times to repeat its process.
# It’s process should be: 1. ask the user for a value (any type)
# 2. Append that value to the list. Once that is done, ask the user
# to press q to quit or to input a number to access that index of the
# list. There should be a different error message depending on the type
# of error raised. Whether or not there are errors, when the user is done
# (or there is an error), it should print the list and ask the user
#  whether they would like to continue. If this input is ‘y’, call the
# function again.
