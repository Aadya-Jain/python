"""
Write a modified version of the Matrix class(that was defined in
one of the example problems in this section) so that the __str__
method instead returns a string containing a single number: the
matrixâ€™s Frobenius norm. The formula for the Frobenius norm will
be the square root of the sum of all the elements squared in the
matrix. Also, the unmodified Matrix class code will be given.
