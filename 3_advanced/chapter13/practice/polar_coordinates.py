"""
Write a class called PolarCoordinates which will take a
value called radius and angle. When we print this class,
we want the coordinates in Cartesian coordinates, or we want
you to print two values: x and y. (If you don’t know the
conversion formula, x = radius * cos(angle), y = radius * sin(angle).
Use Python’s built-in math library for the cosine and sine operators)
