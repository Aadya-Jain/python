"""
Write a class called Triangle which will take three tuples
(each tuple contains two integers: the x and y coordinates
of a vertex). Then, define an __add__ operation that acts as
a translation operation. Its input argument will be a tuple
of two integers that will indicate the x and y translations
that will be applied to each coordinate. (basically, add the
tuple to each coordinate of the triangle). Also, define a
vertical and horizontal transformation tool in the form
of __mul__ which will also take a tuple of two integers that
will be multiplied to the x and y coordinates of each vertex
respectively.
