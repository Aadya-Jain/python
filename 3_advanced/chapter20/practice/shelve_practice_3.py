# Create a database to store orders. Next, ask the customer for their
# name and store that as a variable. Next, ask the customer whether
# they want to view their previous order or make a new order.

# If they want to make a new order, use the shelf to store the order
# as the value and the customer’s name as the key.

# If they want to view a previous order, check if their name is in
# the shelf’s keys. If it is, print their previous order.
# If not, tell them that they haven’t ordered.
# Remember to close the shelf.
# Hint: to store their order, you can do: shelf[name] = order
