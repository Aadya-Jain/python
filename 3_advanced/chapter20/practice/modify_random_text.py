# Create a program that creates a blank text file and writes a
# random number (in the form of a string) between 1 and 1000 on it.
# Next, close the file. Next, open the file again (this time read it)
# and read the text. Assign a variable to that data.
# print (not write) the variable, then print the int(variable) * 4.
