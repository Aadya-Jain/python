# Use mydatabase.db; Using it, first get all the keys and put them into a list.
# For help on this, see the hint below. Next, sort the list. Finally, print the
# corresponding values.
# To do that, do print((shelfname)[key]) where (shelfname) is the name of your
# shelf and key is the key.

# Hint: to get a dictionary or shelf’s keys, all you have to do is this:
"""
for key in myshelf.keys():
     keylist.append(key)
"""
# Keep in mind that the “myshelf” is just a name for a dictionary or shelf and
# that the “keylist” is just a list holding the keys.
