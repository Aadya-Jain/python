# Make a two-player hockey game! The application will consist
# of two rectangular paddles, starting on each side of the screen,
# and one circular ball that players must bounce around. Players can
# move the paddles in any direction to hit the ball into the goal.
# If the ball makes contact with safe parts of the screen, it will
# bounce off at a random angle but in the same general direction
# (left or right). It will do the same if it makes contact with one
# of the paddles, but will head towards the opposite general direction
# instead. If the ball touches the goals on either side of the screen,
# the application will say “Game Over. Player _ Wins”. You must put
# your code in classes and have separate keys for each player to
# move their paddles.
